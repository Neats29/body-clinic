This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

# Decisions

- I chose Next.js as an opportunity to learn it, and because it allows for an API out of the box. I also liked how bare-bones the template was
- styling: material UI
- faces generated by https://generated.photos/

# TODO

- [x] choose a component library
- [ ] fix the font issue
- [ ] add images for each practitioner https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/assets-metadata-css/assets
- [ ] create the homepage, listing the image and a short blurb on each practitioner
- [ ] create a page for each practitioner
- [ ] create a booking form
